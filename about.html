## About

Since discovering web designing in 7<sup>th</sup> grade I, John Claude, developed a passion for all things
programming. I went on to attend the <a href="">Cape Academy for Maths, Science and Technology</a> where I excelled in Information Technology among other subjects. During this time I attended numerous hackathons and tech-related events of which I won a few. Currently, I am doing my bachelors degree in Computer Sciences at the <a href="https://www.uwc.ac.za/">University of the Western Cape</a>. In my spare time I have interned for a few companies and organizations and the ones that stood out for me are <a href="http://code4sa.org/">Code4SA</a>, <a href="www.openboxsoftware.com/">Open Box Software</a> and for Phil Benoit. Projects that I have worked on include, the <a href="http://www.codebridge.co.za/">codebridge website</a>, <a href="www.openbylaws.org.za">openbylaws.org</a>, CLR Women and <a href="http://code4sa.org/">Code4SA</a> to name a few.

<small>In my free time, I can be found hiking, coding, chilling with my squad and/or listening to any artist from <a href="dreamville.com/">Dreamville Records</a>. Basically, just living. Oh, I also like blogging about random topics. Read a few below.</small>
