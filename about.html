## About

I, John Claude, am currently doing my BSc degree in Computer Sciences at the <a href="https://www.uwc.ac.za/">University of the Western Cape</a>. In my spare time I have interned for a few companies and organizations and the ones that stood out for me are <a href="http://code4sa.org/">Code4SA</a>, <a href="www.openboxsoftware.com/">Open Box Software</a> and for Phil Benoit of <a href="http://kiwidc.com/">kiwidc</a>. Projects that I have worked on include, the <a href="http://www.codebridge.co.za/">codebridge website</a>, <a href="www.openbylaws.org.za">openbylaws.org</a>, CLR Women and <a href="http://code4sa.org/">Code4SA</a> to name a few.

<small>In my free time, I can be found hiking, coding, relaxing with friends and/or listening to any artist from <a href="dreamville.com/">Dreamville Records</a>. Basically, just living. Oh, I also like blogging about random topics. I'll be posting soon.</small>

If you would like to get in touch, <a class="page-scroll" href="#contact">contact me.</a>
